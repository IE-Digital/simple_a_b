Simple A/B Reports Google

This module, with the help of the Google Analytics module,
will send events to Google Analytics.

Once the module has been enabled simply navigate to
"/admin/config/user-interface/simple-a-b/settings" and
select "Google Analytics" as the Reporting method.

Other than that there is nothing currently nothing else to configure.
