Simple A/B

This is the core module for Simple A/B
it controls everything to do with setting up and creating tests.

Currently this module can only create tests for custom blocks
and can send to reports to Google Analytics.

To create a test goto "/admin/config/user-interface/simple-a-b"
create a new test, and filling in the form and enable the new a/b test.

You might have to clear the cache
for these new test to take effect once enabled.
